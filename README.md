# VT220 - VS Code theme

Just a simple green theme based  on old CRT monitors and their (lovely) flaws, namely scanlines, RGB shift (on some elements when hovered) and (emulated) glow. Made it mostly for myself, but putting it out there in the wild as I know there's other folks that share my dubious taste.

Custom VS Settings:

```
{
  "editor.cursorSmoothCaretAnimation": true,
  "editor.cursorBlinking": "phase",
  "editor.cursorStyle": "block",
}
```

Optional but recommended: download and install these custom fonts on your computer for the complete look.
